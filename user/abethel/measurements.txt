delta from base_link to t265. This does not rotate!

Each of the d455s is on a rotating mount, and the mount causes the
camera to swivel about a point that is not the center of the camera.

  From base_link to the center of left-right rotation:
  Z = 18.034 inches.
  Y = 10.841 inches.
  X = 10.579 inches.

  From center of left-right rotation to the center of up-down rotation:
  Z = 1.569 inches.
  Y = 0.715 inches.
  X = 0.000 inches.

  From the center of up-down rotation to the center of the camera:
  Z = 1.550 inches.
  Y = 0.586 inches.
  X = 0.893 inches.

These are mirrored on the other side of the robot: mirror y.
